# JupySQL vs ipython-sql

JupySQL is an actively maintained fork of [ipython-sql](https://github.com/catherinedevlin/ipython-sql); it is a drop-in replacement for 99% cases with a lot of new features.

## Incompatibilities

If you're migrating from `ipython-sql` to JupySQL, these are the differences (it most cases, no code changes are needed):

- Since `0.6` JupySQL no longer supports old versions of IPython
- Variable expansion is being replaced from `{variable}`, `${variable}` to `{{variable}}`
